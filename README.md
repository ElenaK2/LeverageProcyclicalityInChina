# Leverage Procyclicality in Chinese financial entities 

### group project
Our study aims to understand whether the leverage of Chinese financial entities follows a procyclical pattern, impacting systemic risk in the financial sector. Procyclicality implies an increase in leverage during economic growth and a decrease during recessions. The analysis covers 145 Chinese financial institutions from the fourth quarter of 2005 to the first quarter of 2023.
